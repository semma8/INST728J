    <h1>Brick Colonial Buildings</h1>
    <h2>A Pleasant Walking tour</h2>
    <p>McKeldin Mall is book-ended (east to west) by the Main Administration building and <b>McKeldin Library</b> (<em>the main library on campus</em>) and along the north and south borders by various academic buildings, which are the homes to many departments in the <strong>College of Behavioral and Social Sciences</strong>, College of Arts and Humanities, and the <strong>College of Agriculture and Natural Resources</strong>. A 16-foot-by-250-foot rectangular fountain features prominently on the eastern half of the mall, honoring the university's members of the <strong>Omicron Delta Kappa</strong> society. A sundial, honoring <strong>Dutch astronomer Uco van Wijk</strong> (<em>who founded the university's astronomy program</em>) sits in the center of the mall, at the edge of the ODK fountain.[4] Looking across the mall from the front entrance of McKeldin Library towards the Administration Building sits <i>Testudo</i>, the mascot of the University of Maryland.

                The mall underwent a substantial renovation in 1990.
